  <li>The option "max authentication failures" specifies the maximum number of authentication failures that are allowed before the client is disconnected from the wireless network.</li>
  <li>"Cache user information for subsequent connections to this network" allows the device to store the user's login credentials for a wireless network, so that the user does not have to enter their credentials every time they connect to the network.</li>

    If you check this option, client will verify the server’s identity by validating the certificate presented by the server during the authentication process. This helps ensure that the client is connecting to the intended server and not an imposter. If the certificate is not valid or cannot be verified, the client will not connect to the network. If you uncheck it, the client will connect to the network without verifying the identity of the server.
  </li>
  <li>You need to check the Trusted Root CA here.</li>
  <li>
    “Don’t ask user to authorize new servers or trusted CAs” means that the user will not be prompted to authorize new servers or trusted certification authorities when connecting to a wireless network.
  </li>
  <li>You can choose different authentication method here. (PEAP‑TLS or PEAP‑MSCHAPv2)</li>
  <li>
    “Enable fast reconnect” allows the device to quickly reconnect to a previously connected wireless network.
    <br>
    “Disconnect if server does not present cryptobinding TLV” specifies whether to disconnect from a wireless network if the server does not present a cryptobinding TLV.
    <br>
    “Enable Identity Privacy” allows the device to use a randomized MAC address when connecting to a wireless network, which helps protect the user’s privacy by preventing the network from tracking the device based on its MAC address.

  <li>This section defines how you choose smart card or certificate when doing authentication. You can go to Advanced for more selections.</li>
  <li>
    If you check this option, client will verify the server’s identity by validating the certificate presented by the server during the authentication process. This helps ensure that the client is connecting to the intended server and not an imposter. If the certificate is not valid or cannot be verified, the client will not connect to the network. If you uncheck it, the client will connect to the network without verifying the identity of the server.
  </li>
  <li>
    List the server name of RADIUS server that you allow client to connect. The RADIUS servers that are not listed are untrusted and client will not connect to them.
    <br>
    It is not necessary to list.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you do not check anything here, the certificates issued by Trusted Root CAs in NTAuth store will be used for authentication.
    <br>
    If you check specific Trusted Root CAs, only certificates issued by selected Root CAs will be used for authentication. And no need to use NTAuth store.
    <br>
    It is recommended to select same Trusted Root CAs here and in Advanced settings.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you uncheck this option, when certificate authentication is failed, the user will be prompted to choose to authorize certificate and continue connecting to new servers.
    <br>
    If you check this option, the user will not be prompted to authorize new servers or trusted certification authorities and fail the connection without notification.
  </li>
  <li>
    This option allows the user to specify a different username to use when connecting to a wireless network, instead of the default username associated with the user’s account.

<ol start="16">
  <li>
    Certificate Issuer. When you configure the certificate issuer filter, you can specify that computers must select a certificate that is issued by a specific CA. When you configure this filter, the filter enumerates the root and intermediate certification authorities (CAs) for all certificates that are present in the certificate store on the local computer, and allows you to select the correct CA from the list.
  </li>
  <li>
    Extended Key Usage (EKU). The extended key usage (EKU) is a certificate extension that specifies the intended purposes of the public key contained in the certificate.
  </li>
  <li>
    “All purpose” EKU. This option allows the certificate to be used for any purpose, including client authentication, server authentication, and other purposes. This is the most permissive option and should be used only when necessary.
  </li>
  <li>
    “Client auth and other EKUs”. This option allows the certificate to be used for client authentication and other purposes, but not for server authentication.
  </li>
  <li>
    “Any purpose and other EKUs”. This option allows the certificate to be used for any purpose and other authorized purposes, but not for client or server authentication.
